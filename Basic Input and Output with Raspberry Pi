# This program controls an LED and a push-button, making the LED blink when the button is pressed.

Part 1 code
from gpiozero import LED
import time

# Initialize LED on GPIO pin 17 with active_high=False because LED is active when GPIO is low
led = LED(17, active_high=False)

# Infinite loop for blinking the LED
while True:
    led.on()        # Turn LED on
    time.sleep(1)   # Wait for 1 second
    led.off()       # Turn LED off
    time.sleep(1)   # Wait for 1 second
Part 2 Code
from gpiozero import Button, LED
import time

# Initialize LED (active low) and Button with debouncing
led = LED(17, active_high=False)
button = Button(27, bounce_time=0.25)

# Infinite loop to monitor button
while True:
    if button.value == 1:
        print("Button was pressed!")
        # Blink LED 5 times (on for 0.5s, off for 0.5s)
        led.blink(on_time=0.5, off_time=0.5, n=5)
        # Sleep allows the blink cycle to complete (5 blinks Ã— 1s per blink = 5s)
        time.sleep(5)
  # Add delay to slow down the loop
    time.sleep(0.25)
